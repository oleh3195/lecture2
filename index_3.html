	<h3> Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino,
		 California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software,
			and online services. The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone,
			 the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player,
				the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart
				 speaker. Apple's software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media
					player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity
					 suites, as well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Xcode.
						Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store and Mac App Store,
						 Apple Music, and iCloud.
			Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop
			 and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated as Apple Computer,
				Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, saw significant
				 momentum and revenue growth for the company. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had
					hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980
					 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers
						featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, and Apple's marketing commercials
						 for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of
							its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles
							 between executives at the company. Jobs resigned from Apple and created his own company, NeXT.
			As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to
			 lower-priced products from competitors, in particular those offered with the Microsoft Windows
				operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO Gil Amelio in
				 1997 decided to buy NeXT to bring Jobs back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a
					process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own retail stores
					 in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of
						software titles, and changing some of the hardware used in its computers. It again saw
						 success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple
							Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer
							 electronics. He also announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant
								financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications,
								 and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an
								  era for the company.
			Apple is the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the world's
			 second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung. In February 2015, Apple became the
				first U.S. company to be valued at over US$700 billion. The company employs 123,000
				 full-time employees as of September 2017 and maintains 499 retail stores in 22 countries
					as of December 2017. It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music 
					retailer. As of January 2016, more than one billion Apple products are actively in use
					 worldwide.
					 Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $229 billion for the 2017 fiscal year. 
					 The company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty and has been repeatedly ranked as the
						world's most valuable brand. However, it receives significant criticism regarding the
						 labor practices of its contractors, its environmental and business practices, 
						 including anti-competitive behavior, as well as the origins of source materials.
						 Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and
							Ronald Wayne.[4] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer
							 single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak,[5][6] and first shown to the 
							 public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[7][8] Apple I was sold as a motherboard 
							 (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is now 
							 considered a complete personal computer.[9] The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 
							 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,867 in 2017 dollars, adjusted for inflation).
							 [10][11][12][13][14][15]
						 Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[16][17] without Wayne,
							who left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only a
							 couple weeks after co-founding Apple.[18][19] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided
								essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of
								 Apple.[20][21] During the first five years of operations revenues grew 
								 exponentially, 	doubling about every four months. Between September 1977
									and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average 
								annual growth rate of 533%.[22][23]
						 The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first
							West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and
							 Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open
								architecture. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage
								Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[16][17] without Wayne,
								who left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only. </h3>
